Recipe Book Generator

---

See [here](http://scootah.com/recipe/) for a sample of the output.

Given a set of input files containing food, measurement, combination instructions, and so on, generate a cookbook. Uses the flickr API (through the flickrapi library) to find appropriate images and includes them after each recipe title.

Yay, [NaNoGenMo](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo)!
